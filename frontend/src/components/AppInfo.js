      <p>I decided to take a more spiritual route for my application! There are several religous based applications available to the public, however I decided to create an app which makes use of a combination of several features, not only from a religious standpoint, but also from a learning standpoint in terms of what we have learnt over the bootcamp, and trying to implement it. </p>
      <p>My religion is something which is very special to me, and has a large precedence in my purpose, so I thought it would be fun to create an application, which can be built upon in the future, that integrates different things which one may seek for across numerous apps.</p>
      <p>You may notice particular features to be quite basic, such as the supplication counter! Or maybe, the daily prayer tracker. In truth, I had limited time, however, the way the project is structured, is that I can always revist in the future to continue honing out different parts of it.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>p.s: my personal favourite feature of the application is the music player. If you haven't seen it already, be sure to click the little button in the bottom right!</p>
