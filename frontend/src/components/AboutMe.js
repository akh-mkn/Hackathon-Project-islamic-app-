      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello! Just to keep things very brief, I am Matti, the creator of this application. I recently finished A-Levels, and decided to challenge the norm, hence undertaking a less conventional pathway, as some may say. And this was indeed via an apprenticship. Now grateful to be working at one of the biggest corporations, not just on a national basis, but also an international basis, developments like this are always teaching me something new.</p>
      <p> This application was made with a lot.. and I mean a lot of difficulty. If it was easy however, it wouldn't be as fruitful. I think I may have broken some form of record, abusing the Google search engine to understand how to code this, or code that. From websites, to forums, to prompting the Multiverse in-house AI, bit by bit I was able to craft this application.</p>
      <p>The thing is, I entered this bootcamp with little to no programming knowledge. Not only has this bootcamp built upon my programming skills, but it has enhanced all the different aspects which make up a Software Engineer. From utilising Github  - something I wasn't even aware about before - to IDE's, to terminal commands, to this and to that. I truly believe it is much deeper than raw syntax code. It's about the logic behind it. It's about the collaboration behind it. It's about the different applications you can utilise behind it.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Apologies for boring you, you can find a bit more detail as to the purpose behind this application on the App Info page! And if you ever want to leave a message, you can do via the Contact Me form :D </p>
